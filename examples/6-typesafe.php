/*
 * One important design goal was the principle of the least surprise.
 * As PHP is a fully dynamic language with nearly no type-safety, it is common to shoot yourself into the foot because of accidentally mixing up incompatible types.
 * We protect you from these programing errors by asserting that every callback functions you supply to the library must return a correctly typed value.
 * In addition, every supported aggregate function will throw an exception if you are accidentally mixing up incompatible types.
 *
 * This means that we made this library totally predictable in what it does, and verified that every function has its defined exceptions
 * which are thrown when certain operations fail, or if certain types are not correct.
